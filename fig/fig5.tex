	\caption{Impulse response functions when IES=1.5. This figure shows the impulse re- sponse functions of Pareto weights, consumption, exchange rate, and stochastic discount factors to a shock to the home endowment for both the home country (solid line) and the foreign country (dashed line). All parameters are calibrated as in Colacito and Croce (2013). Shocks materialize only in the home country, and only at time 1. Shocks are not orthogonalized; we consider a positive $\sigma$ shock in the short-run, and a positive $\sigma_x$ shock for the long-run.}
