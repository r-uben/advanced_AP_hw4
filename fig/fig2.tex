	\caption{This figure shows the impulse response	function of the log of the ratio of the Pareto weights, $\log(S_t)$, and the world consumption share of the home country, $SWC_t$. Shocks to the home country good endowment, $x$, materialize at time 1. Domestic and foreign shocks are cross-country correlated in the model. In this figure, we focus on their orthogonal component and use standard deviations $ \sigma\sqrt{1+\rho^2_{xy}}$ and $ \sigma_x\sqrt{1+\rho^2_{12}}$ for short- and long-run news, respectively. All parameters are calibrated as in Colacito \& Croce (2013).}
